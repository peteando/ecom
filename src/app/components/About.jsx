                     <p className="mb-20">Hello, my name is Peter and I'm a web developer who is just starting out in
                          the industry. I'm passionate about creating beautiful and functional websites
                           that solve problems for businesses and individuals. I'm a quick learner and
                            constantly expanding my skill set to stay up-to-date with the latest web development
                             trends and technologies. My experience includes coding in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
                              as well as using frameworks like Bootstrap and jQuery to create responsive and dynamic web pages. 
                              I believe that good communication and collaboration are essential for successful web development projects. 
                              I enjoy working with clients to understand their needs and goals, and then using my technical 
                              expertise to bring their vision to life. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring 
                              new coffee shops, playing guitar and video games. I'm excited to continue growing as a 
                              web developer and look forward to working on new projects and collaborating with other professionals in the field.</p>
